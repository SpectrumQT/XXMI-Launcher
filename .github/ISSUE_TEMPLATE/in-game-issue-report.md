> 💡  Most in-game issues are **game-specific** and not directly related to **XXMI Launcher** or the **XXMI DLL**. Such reports **will not be accepted here** and should be routed to Model Importer repositories instead. Model Importers are being maintained by different devs and they won't check this thread.

## 🧩 Before You Report an Issue

If the issue only happens when using certain mods, please **check the following first**:

- ✅ Make sure the mods are **up to date**.
- 🕒 If the mod page hasn't been updated since the **last game update**, the mod may be **incompatible**.
- 🔧 For such mods you usually can find **mod fixing tools and guides** provided by the community.
- 👤 Try reaching out to the **mod author** for support.
- 💬 You can also ask for help in the [AGMG Modding Community Discord](https://discord.gg/agmg).

> ❗ Only continue with this issue report if you’ve exhausted these steps and have **good reason to believe the problem is related to the Model Importer** itself.
